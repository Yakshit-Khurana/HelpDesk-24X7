            <h2>Independence Day</h2>
            <p>On the night of August 15, 1947, the first Prime Minister of Independent India, Jawaharlal Nehru, said, “At the stroke of the midnight hour, when the world sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom.” These words aptly captured the struggle and happiness of newly-independent India as it finally managed to free itself from the clutches of British rule.

                To mark the historic day, Jawaharlal Nehru hoisted the Indian national flag above the Lahori Gate of Red Fort in Delhi. This became a symbolic gesture, and continues to take place every year on August 15 as the India celebrates its Independence Day. The day is celebrated with much fervour throughout the country with flag-hoisting ceremonies, drills, cultural events, and the singing of the Indian National Anthem. As the country celebrates its 75th Independence day this year, let us take a look at the history and significance of this day.</p>
